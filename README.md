# PortScanner

This Python script performs port scanning and banner grabbing for a remote host.

Service Detection in cybersecurity refers to the process of identifying the specific services running on open ports of a target system. This involves determining the type of application or protocol that is listening on a given port (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.).

Banner Grabbing is a technique used to gather information about a service running on an open port by capturing and analyzing the initial response (banner) from the service. Many network services will send a banner when a connection is established, which often includes information about the service type, version, and other details.
